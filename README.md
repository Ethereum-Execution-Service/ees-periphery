# EES

EES (Ethereum Execution Service) is an open protocol for on-chain automation. Developers can create applications on top of EES which benefit from timely execution. Automation is achieved by opening execution up to the public through financial incentivization. The code is being built in public and has not yet been audited, so use at your own risk. More info will come soon. For now, you can read more [here](https://docs.ees.xyz).
